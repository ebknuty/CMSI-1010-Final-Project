## Overview  

Our project is a 2D Cave Shooter is a wave-based, top-down shooter game we devloped using Pygame. Players control a soldier who must survive against successive waves of enemy units. Each wave increases in difficulty by spawning a greater number of faster enemies, providing a progressively challenging experience.

## Features

# Player Mechanics:

- Movement with W/A/S/D (including diagonal movement normalization).

- Aiming via mouse cursor and shooting with left click.

- Reload functionality bound to R.

- Enemy Behavior: Enemies spawn around the player and navigate toward the player’s position using vector normalization.

# Health and Damage:

- Player health: 100 HP with invincibility frames after taking damage.
